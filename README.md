# LIN-Local-Interconnect-Network-Example
This repository holds the basic code for an educational LIN (Local Interconnect Network) driver. It accompanies the course offered on http://www.invehiclelan.com.

# Repository Code Master/Slave example: 

Dive into the world of _Local Interconnect Network (LIN)_ with this educational driver. 

This repository contains the source code for two examples that demonstrate the core functionalities of a LIN network. 

Explore the 'Hello World' LIN package, learn about schedule table setup, initialization, and simple scheduling of LIN packages between the Master and the Slave. 
Discover how to handle frame handling and break symbol generation in the master node. 

You can find the core driver logic according to the protocol in the '_JRLinMaster.cpp_' and '_JRLinSlave.cpp_' files.

# LIN (Local Interconnect Network) Course: 

If you want to learn more about LIN in general and it's application, please support me by attending the course on http://www.invehiclelan.com.
There  you will learn everything you need to know about the Automotive low-cost, lightweight protocol, as well as the basic hardware setup for this example. 

The course provides a deep dive into application software and LIN drivers. 

The course is structured around practical examples, including a LIN network with three nodes. 
Learn how to control LED lights with the master node, transfer signals between nodes, and analyze your network with an oscilloscope. 
The course emphasizes code readability and practical demonstrations, making it a great resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

**Happy learning and coding!**
